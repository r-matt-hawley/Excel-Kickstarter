# Exploring Kickstarter Campagins

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. In an attempt to discover trends among successful campaigns I analyzed a database of four thousand past projects.

This analysis uses pivot tables and charts to analyze trends among project categories, geographic location, and time when the project was created.
